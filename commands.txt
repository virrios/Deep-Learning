git init
As an example, you usually run git push origin master to push your local changes to your online repository.
To rename a branch, you'd use the same git push command, but you would add one more argument: the name of the new branch. For example:

git push  <REMOTENAME> <LOCALBRANCHNAME>:<REMOTEBRANCHNAME> 
This pushes the LOCALBRANCHNAME to your REMOTENAME, but it is renamed to REMOTEBRANCHNAME.
